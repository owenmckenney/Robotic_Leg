# 2 DOF Robotic Leg
Python code and CAD files for a single, 2 DOF robotic leg. This design uses 2 [3D printed robotic actuators](https://github.com/owenmckenney/Robotic_Actuator) as well as a Raspberry Pi to achieve planar leg motion. This leg mainly serves as a way to test the design of these actuators; a third DOF oriented orthagonal to the current 2 axis would be necessary for a more functional and realistic leg. The materials needed to replicate this design are listed in the [BOM]().
